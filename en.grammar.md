# Grammar
CAMEL (Computation And Mathematics Expression Language) is a programming language designed for simple mathematical calculations. Here is the summary of CAMEL's syntax:

## Variable Declaration
```
let variable_name = value
```
Declares a variable and assigns an initial value. The value can be an integer or the value of another variable.  

## Input
```
input variable_name
```
Prompts the user to enter a value, which is then stored in the variable. The input value is of integer type.    

## Output
```
output variable_name
```
Displays the value of a variable.  

## Arithmetic Operations
```
add variable_name1 variable_name2 variable_name_to_store_result
sub variable_name1 variable_name2 variable_name_to_store_result
mul variable_name1 variable_name2 variable_name_to_store_result
div variable_name1 variable_name2 variable_name_to_store_result
```
Performs arithmetic operations on the values of variable_name1 and variable_name2, and stores the result in the specified variable.  

## Comment
```
# comment
```
Lines starting with "#" are comments and are ignored during execution.  

## Error Handling
If there is an error in the CAMEL program, an error message is displayed.
